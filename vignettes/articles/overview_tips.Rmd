## Tips

If you are new to the raster package, I hope to collect here some useful tips
how to handle raster data in general. Furthermore, this section also serves
as a place to collect workflows on how to use **NLMR** and other R packages to
simulate specific patterns one can find in the literature.

### Basics

#### Counting cells

Ecologists are for example often interested in how much habitat one actually finds
in the study area you are looking at and there are a couple of nice ways to do
that with rasters. One of them is:

```{r}
library(NLMR)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)

landscape <- nlm_curds(curds = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.6),
                       recursion_steps = c(32, 6, 2),
                       wheyes = c(0.1, 0.05, 0.2))

# count cells for each category (0 = Matrix, 1 = Habitat)
landscape %>% 
  freq()
```

### More specific tips

#### Use matrix of parameter to simulate landscapes

```{r}
library(NLMR)
library(landscapetools)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)

# simulation function that has the parameters we want to alter as input
simulate_landscape = function(roughness, weighting){
    nlm_mpd(ncol = 33,
            nrow = 33,
            roughness = roughness,
            rescale = TRUE) %>%
        util_classify(weighting = weighting)
}

# paramter combinations we are interested in
param_df = expand.grid(roughness = c(0.2, 0.9),
                       weighting = list(c(0.2, 0.8), c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5))) %>%
    as.tibble()

# map over the nested tibble and use each row as input for our simulation function
nlm_list = param_df %>% pmap(simulate_landscape)

# look at the results
util_facetplot(nlm_list)
```


#### Simulate ecotones

Merging different types of NLMs, such as a planar gradient with a less autocorrelated landscape, provide a means of generating more complex landscapes and realistic-looking ecotones (Travis 2004):

```{r}
library(NLMR)
library(landscapetools)

# landscape with higher autocorrelation 
high_autocorrelation <- nlm_edgegradient(ncol = 100, nrow = 100, direction = 80)

# landscape with lower autocorrelation 
low_autocorrelation <- nlm_fbm(ncol = 100, nrow = 100, fract_dim = 0.5)

# merge to derive ecotone
ecotones <- util_merge(low_autocorrelation, high_autocorrelation)

# look at the results
util_facetplot(list("Low autocorrelation" = low_autocorrelation,
                    "High autocorrelation" = high_autocorrelation,
                    "Ecotones" = ecotones
                    ))
```
