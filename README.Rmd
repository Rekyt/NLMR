# NLMR <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/NLMR/develop/vignettes/logo.png" align="right" />

**NLMR** is an ``R`` package for simulating **n**eutral **l**andscape **m**odels (NLMs). Designed to be a generic framework like [NLMpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nlmpy), it leverages the ability to simulate the most common NLMs that are described in the ecological literature. 
**NLMR** builds on the advantages of the **raster** package and returns all simulation as ``RasterLayer`` objects, thus ensuring a direct compability to common GIS tasks and a flexible and simple usage.
Furthermore, it simulates NLMs within a self-contained, reproducible framework.    

For further information on neutral landscape models, the authors goals for
this package, and additional use case examples please see the associated
publication Sciani, Fritsch, Scherer and Simpkins (2018)

## Installation

Install the release version from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("NLMR")
```

To install the developmental version of **NLMR**, use the following R code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/NLMR", ref = "develop")
```

## Example

Each neutral landscape models is simulated with a single function (all starting with `nlm_`) in `NLMR`, e.g.:

```{r message=FALSE}
random_cluster <- NLMR::nlm_randomcluster(nrow = 100,
                                      ncol = 100,
                                      p    = 0.5,
                                      ai   = c(0.3, 0.6, 0.1),
                                      rescale = FALSE)

random_curdling <- NLMR::nlm_curds(curds = c(0.5, 0.3, 0.6),
                              recursion_steps = c(32, 6, 2))


midpoint_displacememt <- NLMR::nlm_mpd(ncol = 100,
                                 nrow = 100,
                                 roughness = 0.61)
```

## Overview

**NLMR** supplies 14 NLM algorithms, with several options to simulate derivates of
them. The algorithms differ from each other in spatial auto-correlation, from 
no auto-correlation (random NLM) to a constant gradient (planar gradients):

**NLMR** was split during its development process - to have a minimal dependency version
for simulating neutral landscape models and an utility toolbox to facilate workflows
with raster data.
If you are interested in merging, visualizing or further handling neutral landscape models
have a look at the [landscapetools](https://github.com/ropensci/landscapetools/) package.
